## Start here: AI Agents Learning Hub

**[Open the AI Agents Learning Hub →](https://mahsa-teimourikia.github.io/awesome-ai-agents/)**

The Hub is the main learning experience. Choose a level, select a topic, read
the explanation, run the linked notebook, then complete its
checkpoint. It keeps progress in the browser and links every lesson to its
source material.

## What is an AI agent?

An AI agent combines a model with instructions, tools, state or memory, and a
control loop so it can pursue a goal over multiple steps. An agentic workflow
uses similar parts but keeps more of the path explicit in code. Production
systems add identity, policy, budgets, evaluation, tracing, recovery, and human
oversight around the model.

Start with the least autonomous design that reliably solves the task:

| Choose | When it fits |
| --- | --- |
| Single model call | A well-defined response needs no external action |
| Deterministic workflow | Steps and branches are known and need auditability |
| Agentic workflow | Code owns the path but selected decisions need model judgment |
| Single agent | Tool feedback determines an open-ended path |
| Multi-agent system | Distinct context, tools, parallelism, or independent review measurably help |

## Explore the curriculum

Every topic has a co-located `README.md`, deep dive topics, and self-contained notebook. The notebooks are the primary theory-and-practice surface.

## How to use a lesson locally

Each topic folder contains:

```text
curriculum/<level>/<topic>/
├── README.md     # guided theory, diagrams, references, and exercises
├── *.ipynb       # self-contained notebook: theory and implementation together
└── *.md          # deep dive topics
```

Clone the repository, create a Python environment, and install only the dependency groups you need:

- **Foundations:** `pip install -e '.[beginner]'`
- **Frameworks:** `pip install -e '.[beginner,frameworks]'`
- **Computer-Using Agents:** `pip install -e '.[beginner,browser]'`
- **Intermediate/Advanced:** `pip install -e '.[intermediate]'` or `pip install -e '.[advanced]'`

Run the lab first, then open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook curriculum/beginner/02-agent-loop/
```

Default labs are designed to run without credentials or external side effects.
Provider-specific extensions are explicitly marked and should use your own
environment variables and scoped credentials.
